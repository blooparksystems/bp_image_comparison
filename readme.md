Notes
-----
This addon is based on the Zurb pluggin and has been developed and tested for Odoo v8.0. The screenshot shows the snippet with our custom Bloopark theme. It might look different if you have a custom theme installed. All styling is done in Sass and compiled with Grunt, which is why the CSS is minified. If you need help styling the snippet to your needs please don't hesitate to contact us.
